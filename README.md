# Ribbot
Ribbot is a lightweight, single-server Discord bot written using [Discord4J](https://discord4j.com) on top of the 
[Quarkus framework](https://quarkus.io). It runs in a Minikube cluster as a native executable in production, packaged 
using the [Discord4J Quarkus extension](https://github.com/cameronprater/quarkus-discord4j).

## Features
The feature set of Ribbot is currently limited, focusing on code quality, encapsulation, ease of development, and 
extensibility over the quantity of features. The latest release includes support for reaction roles and developer-only 
utilities. Any ongoing development efforts to add additional features to Ribbot will be maintained in the issue tracker.
